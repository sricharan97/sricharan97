*Technical Specialist turned Android Developer – fusing code with user‑centric design to craft intuitive mobile experiences.*

## About Me  
Hello! I'm **Charan Konduri**, an aspiring Android developer transitioning from a Technical Specialist role at IBM. Over **6 years at IBM**, I oversaw the reliability of 20+ enterprise applications and managed hundreds of automated scripts to streamline critical processes. This experience honed my skills in **system design, performance optimization, and process automation**, and I’m excited to bring that operational rigor into the world of mobile app development.  

After hours of coding batch processes and ensuring 99.9% uptime in enterprise systems, I discovered my passion for **mobile UI/UX design and development**. I pivoted my career towards Android development – completing the **Google Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree** and the **Meta Android Developer Professional Certificate** – to master modern Android tools and best practices. These programs gave me hands-on experience with Kotlin, Android Studio, Jetpack libraries, Firebase, and even React Native. Now, I specialize in building Android apps with **clean architecture** and **test-driven development**, ensuring that my code is as robust as it is clean. I love working on intuitive user interfaces and seamless **API integrations**, always keeping the end-user experience in focus.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, Javascript 
- **Android:** Jetpack Compose, XML views, MVVM (ViewModel & LiveData), Coroutines  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React · React Native · Jetpack Compose · Ktor · Retrofit · Room
- **Tools:** Android Studio, Git & GitHub, Figma, Canva, JUnit/Espresso  

## Projects  
- **[FitStreak](https://github.com/sricharan97/FitStreak)** – A full-featured fitness tracker app with integration for Google Fit and Firebase authentication, plus rich motion animations. Built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose following MVVM architecture to help users track workouts and maintain streaks.  
- **[Location Reminder](https://github.com/sricharan97/LocationReminder)** – A geofencing-based task reminder app that uses Google Maps to notify users of tasks when they enter a specific location. Ensures important to-dos are never forgotten by tying reminders to physical places.  
- **[Asteroid Radar](https://github.com/sricharan97/AsteroidRadar)** – An offline-first space object viewer powered by NASA’s asteroid API. This Kotlin app downloads and caches near-Earth asteroid data, displaying details with an intuitive master-detail UI (part of Udacity Nanodegree projects).  
- **[Little Lemon (Android)](https://github.com/sricharan97/LittleLemonApp)** – A Compose-based food ordering app with advanced UI features. It showcases dynamic UI components, state management with ViewModel, and an engaging design inspired by a modern restaurant app (final project from Meta’s Android certificate).  
- **[Little Lemon Newsletter (React Native)](https://github.com/sricharan97/LittleLemonNewsletter)** – A cross-platform mobile app for Little Lemon’s newsletter sign-up, built with React Native. It features a Welcome screen and a Subscribe form with email validation and navigation between screens, demonstrating my ability to apply Android skills in a React Native context as well.  

## Certifications  
- **Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree – Udacity/Google:** An in-depth Nanodegree program covering Android app development with Kotlin, including custom views, Firebase integration, and advanced Android features. (Certificate of Completion, 2025)  
- **Meta Android Developer Professional Certificate – Coursera:** A professional certification from Meta that provided a well-rounded Android skill set – from Kotlin and Android Studio to React Native and UI/UX design principles. (Completed in 2024)
